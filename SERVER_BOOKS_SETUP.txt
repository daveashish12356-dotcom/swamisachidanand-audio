Books/Thumbnails server setup
----------------------------
App loads 56 books from: strings.xml -> server_books_base_url

Current URL: https://daveashish12356-dotcom.github.io/swamisachidanand-audio/

MAKE ALL PDFs ONLINE (automatic deploy)
--------------------------------------
1. Push this repo to GitHub (repo name = swamisachidanand-audio for the URL above).
2. Workflow runs on push and deploys to gh-pages branch.
3. On GitHub: Repo > Settings > Pages > Build and deployment:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages" (folder / (root))
4. Save. After 1-2 min run: python check_server_56_books.py
   You should see: Thumbnails: 56/56 OK, Books (PDF): 56/56 OK.

The workflow copies public/books and public/thumbnails to gh-pages branch, so base URL serves books/ and thumbnails/.

If your repo name is different (e.g. "ss"), change server_books_base_url in app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml to:
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
(no trailing path, end with /)


Verify server from app (check server se app se)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Run app, open "પુસ્તક" (Books) tab.
2. In Android Studio Logcat, filter by "ServerBookLoader".
   You will see:
   - "loaded 56 books, baseUrl=..."
   - "sample thumbnailUrl=..." and "sample pdfUrl=..." (copy these to browser to test)
   - "Server check: OK (HTTP 200)" if server is reachable and first thumbnail exists
   - "Server check: HTTP 404" or "Server check: failed" if server unreachable or file names don't match

3. If Server check fails: paste the logged thumbnailUrl in browser. If 404, upload
   public/thumbnails/ to repo as "thumbnails/" (file names must match app's books_server_list.json).
   Same for books/ and PDFs.
